Caper - Tools for XDebug Function Tracing
=========================================

Manage, parse and analyse `XDebug function traces
<http://xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace>`_.

Doesn't really do much yet. I'm mostly using it to show me the combinations of
arguments to my project APIs so I can work out which test cases I'm missing.

The code is very hackable if you aren't too "OO Doctrinaire" and I welcome
contributions or suggestions that aren't things like "Please make PSR-999
compatible for no good reason" or "I replaced your yucky bare arrays with 200
objects just because".

I'm certain more interesting reports are possible, I just haven't thought of
them yet.
